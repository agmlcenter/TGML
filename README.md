Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) generalize Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) to temporal graphs. They do so by introducing a node memory which represents the state of the node at a given time, acting as a compressed representation of the nodeâ€™s past interactions. Every time two nodes are involved in an interaction, they send messages to each other which are then used to update their memories. When computing the embedding of a node, an additional graph aggregation is performed over the temporal neighbors of the node, using both the original node features and memory at that point in time.
